the only thing that i didn’t like about this course is the three hour long lecture every week.,"The only thing that I didn’t like about this course is the 3 hour long lecture every week. I think the lecture could be cut down to 2 hours and we would be able to get just as much out of it. There were many times where we were sitting through hour long discussions of students arguing points on quizzes but I think if there was a shorter period, these discussions would have to be moved to the discussion board so that we can just get through all the material for the week instead of having to sit through a redundant discussion. The only other thing I think should be improved about this course is that I think that the faculty who are assigned to this lab should run through the experiments before students have to carry them out. This quarter, we spent about 4 weeks carrying out the same experiment, and in the end we still got negative results. Although I understand that this is something that is common in science, since this is a lab where we should be learning about not only the techniques but also data analysis, when we don’t have data to analyze, then we aren’t really taking as much out of the lab as we should be. In addition to this, we are paying lab fees and I think the equipment in the lab is pretty up to date, but I think a little bit more money could be invested into the materials like the primers that were used for the microbiomics experiments that kept failing. Based on my understanding, the experiment wasn’t working because the primers were not good. After failing 2 times, I think the school should have invested a bit of money to buy some new commercially available primers since they are pretty commonly used.",Other Comments,M116L,2019,Spring,"the only thing that i didn’t like about this course is the three hour long lecture every week. i think the lecture could be cut down to two hours and we would be able to get just as much out of it. there were many times where we were sitting through hour long discussions of students arguing points on quizzes but i think if there was a shorter period, these discussions would have to be moved to the discussion board so that we can just get through all the material for the week instead of having to sit through a redundant discussion. the only other thing i think should be improved about this course is that i think that the faculty who are assigned to this lab should run through the experiments before students have to carry them out. this quarter, we spent about four weeks carrying out the same experiment, and in the end we still got negative results. although i understand that this is something that is common in science, since this is a lab where we should be learning about not only the techniques but also data analysis, when we don’t have data to analyze, then we aren’t really taking as much out of the lab as we should be. in addition to this, we are paying lab fees and i think the equipment in the lab is pretty up to date, but i think a little bit more money could be invested into the materials like the primers that were used for the microbiomics experiments that kept failing. based on my understanding, the experiment wasn’t working because the primers were not good. after failing two times, i think the school should have invested a bit of money to buy some new commercially available primers since they are pretty commonly used.",the only thing that i didn’t like about this course is the three hour long lecture every week.,lab_time_work,time_lecture_spend,negative

i'm wondering how this course strategy is intended to help students learn.,"It would be beneficial if the methods and procedures required for the lab course were explained before the tests and quizzes since exams are defined as testing what was taught by the professor's course rather than what the student learned on their own.

I'm wondering how this course strategy is intended to help students learn. I believe changing this strategy will benefit the students and the professor. If this strategy changed, I think the professor will not make another mistake (answering a complete question incorrectly) even though the professor has a Ph.D. We learned from previous courses that answering questions correctly requires that the individual understands the topic well enough to explain it to another person. I think since there is no explanation happening in the course, this mistake has happened, and I am sure it will reoccur if this strategy is kept used in the upcoming years.

If this strategy changed, I think the professor will not make another mistake (answering a complete question incorrectly) even though the professor has a Ph.D. We learned from previous courses that answering questions correctly requires that the individual understands the topic well enough to explain it to another person.

weekly quizzes need to reflect more on the material covered on the lecture from the previous week.,"Weekly quizzes need to reflect more on the material covered on the lecture from the previous week. It is understandable that these quizzes are designed for students to think more critically, but the students are also given a set of difficult problems every week with barely any guidance from the instructor and minimal help from these learning communities. The lectures also just provide the very minimum of the concepts covered on the quizzes and have provided little to no help in solving the quiz problems. I have discussed with several peers in the class saying that the average for their quiz scores every week are very low, yet no initiative is taken from the professor to go over common mistakes students made/help them understand the material better for future quizzes.

the explanations for why some answers were wrong or right was so short on gradescope and were not always clear.,"I found that not enough time was given to take the quizzes.

The explanations for why some answers were wrong or right was so short on gradescope and were not always clear. Even though the professor goes over the answers during class, it would be nice to have some detailed explanations directly on the graded quiz. The perusall scores also sometimes would take a while to be released.
